                <div class="intro__p_box">
                    <p class="intro__p"><br>A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual's distinct 
                        personality traits.In most instances, your personality will influence relationships with your 
                        family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your health and well-being.Teachers can 
                        administer a personality test in class to help your children discover their strengths and 
                        developmental needs.The driving force behind administering a personality test is to open up 
                        lines of communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for one another.
                        A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what teaching strategies will be the most 
                        effective for their students.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="intro__p">Personality test can benefit your students by:</p><br>
                    <ul class="intro__p list">
                        <li>Increasing productivity</li>
                        <li>Get along better with classmates </li>
                        <li>Help students realize their full potential </li>
                        <li>Identify teaching strategies for students </li>
                        <li>Help students appreciate other personality types</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p class="intro__p">One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality Test.This personality test asks a 
                        serious of questions to rate your likes and dislikes.The test will then rate your personality as either a 
                        blue, green, orange or gold personality type.You may be a combination of two colors, but usually a student will 
                        exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to type cast a student, but it allows teachers 
                        to understand the personality attributes associated with various students.You will operate as one primary 
                        color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental factors can shift your personality
                        type for short intervals.As a rule of thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes 
                        and keep in mind the attributes that irritate people.</p><br>
                    <p class="intro__p">Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the
                        first week of school.A personality test is a fun exercise for the 
                         class and will enable the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities for their students. </p><br><br>
