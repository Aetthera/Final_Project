        <p class="description-text">A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual's distinct 
            personality traits.In most instances, your personality will influence relationships with your 
            family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your health and well-being.Teachers can 
            administer a personality test in class to help your children discover their strengths and 
            developmental needs.The driving force behind administering a personality test is to open up 
            lines of communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for one another.
            A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what teaching strategies will be the most 
            effective for their students.

        <p class="description-text">Personality test can benefit your students by:</p><br>
        <p class="description-text">One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality Test.This personality test asks a 
            serious of questions to rate your likes and dislikes.The test will then rate your personality as either a 
            blue, green, orange or gold personality type.You may be a combination of two colors, but usually a student will 
            exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to type cast a student, but it allows teachers 
            to understand the personality attributes associated with various students.You will operate as one primary 
            color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental factors can shift your personality
            type for short intervals.As a rule of thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes 
            and keep in mind the attributes that irritate people.</p><br>
        <p class="description-text">Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the
            first week of school.A personality test is a fun exercise for the 
             class and will enable the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities for their students. </p>
